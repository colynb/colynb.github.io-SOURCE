My name is Colyn Brown. I've been a web developer since 1995 - almost 20 years now! I've also been raising a family for not much longer than that.

Though my experience in web development covers a lot of areas, I will be  focusing this site on front-end development and related technologies. However, as a consumer of dev blogs myself, the biggest problem I see with a lot of blogs especially ones in a tutorial format is that they are quickly out of date. Some of my entries will be written as a tutorial, but I want to avoid this dilemma.

To do that, what I would like to do _eventually_ is get to a point where this site is more like a wiki and less like a journal. Every page on this site will be open source and hosted on GitHub so that anyone who would like to contribute can make changes to any page, thereby keeping them up to date.

As of today, the site is powered by Docpress, and you can read my [introductory post](/posts/static-site-generation-with-docpad-part-1.html) on my decision to use it.
